# CV2X-SDP
This repo is the implementation of the paper "Roadside Units-Enabled Cooperative Localization Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles Under GNSS-denied Environments: Methodology and Demonstration" (Under Review).

# Data
It contains various simulation data generated in Matlab environment (under Environment_setting file). Users can use these data to test the localization algorithms they have developed. 

- RSS data (named as rssi_noise.mat)
- vehicle trajectory data (named as trace_1.mat)
- RSUs coordinate data (named as AP.mat)
- distance data from vehicle to each RSU (named real_d.mat)
- attenuation factor value (named A.mat)
